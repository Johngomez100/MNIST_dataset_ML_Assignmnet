# MNIST_dataset_ML_Assignmnet
Write a handwritten digit classifier for the MNIST database . These are composed of 70000 28x28 pixel gray-scale images of handwritten digits divided into 60000 training set and 10000 test set.
MNIST Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying the MNIST dataset using various machine learning classifiers. The goal is to compare the performance of different classifiers, including SVM (Linear, Polynomial, RBF), Random Forest, Naive Bayes Beta, and a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The project also includes dimensionality reduction using PCA and performance evaluation through cross-validation and test accuracy.
